## **Project Title**: Students Adaptability Level Prediction in Online Education

**Our motivation**: We decided to work on this problem because online education has become increasingly prevalent, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding students' adaptability to this mode of learning is crucial for improving educational outcomes. This dataset provides valuable insights into factors influencing adaptability, allowing us to explore patterns and build predictive models that can help educators and institutions better support students. By analyzing the adaptability levels, we hope to contribute to the improvement of online education strategies.
